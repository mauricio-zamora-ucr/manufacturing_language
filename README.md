## Visual Assembly Language
In this work, we make a proposal for a new language similar to a programming language, which aims to describe the actions in industrial assembly environments, where an operator performs the actions and an automatic system will be able to verify if the actions they are made according to the standard described by this new language, called Visual Assembly Language.
